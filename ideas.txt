Idea 0:
BRUTE FORCE

Utils:
Generalized input Parser

Generalized outputer

Randomized input generator

Idea 1:
Brute force improvement:
> Sort each players values in descending order
> If < l continue

Idea 2:
2 4
2 2 2 499
1 500 500 500

1 2 499 500

Put all numbers in a set and sort it in descending order > n*m*lg(n*m)
sort each players values in descending order > n*m*lg(m)
l = from the first number to the one before the last of the set
  use that l to update min rankings
  > n*m*n*m -> can we get this lower

(?)
After the first calculations with l = max(#)
Go in a ascending order from player with min sum to the max sum

Idea 3:
If we trim from each player given an l value, we can remove 1 from each with the same value.

Idea 4:
pick l such that c*n is the number of total possible l values
FFT?

Contribution to Idea 2:
We can store the indexes of last changed score of player (according to l value) in an array. (1st array)
We can store the total score of each player in an array. (2nd array)
Within the for loop of l values, we can start with the first score that is not changed according to l with the 1st array. 
We can compare that value with the l value and if the value is larger than l value, we can change the total score of the player found in 2nd array.
If the total score array give the minimum final place than the before, we will change the update the first and the second array respectively.
