Idea 0:
BRUTE FORCE

Utils:
Generalized input Parser

Generalized outputer

Randomized input generator

Idea 1:
Brute force improvement:
> Sort each players values in descending order
> If < l continue

Idea 2:
2 4
2 2 2 499
1 500 500 500

1 2 499 500

Put all numbers in a set and sort it in descending order > n*m*lg(n*m)
sort each players values in descending order > n*m*lg(m)
l = from the first number to the one before the last of the set
  use that l to update min rankings
  > n*m*n*m -> can we get this lower

(?)
After the first calculations with l = max(#)
Go in a ascending order from player with min sum to the max sum

Idea 3:
If we trim from each player given an l value, we can remove 1 from each with the same value.

Idea 4:
pick l such that c*n is the number of total possible l values
FFT?
